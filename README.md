## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    NONE

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

  The challenge that I encountered in creating this submission was that there were a lot of assets that I did not know were important in creating this game. I did not know that you needed javascript, HTML, and CSS to implement how the game works itself. 
  There were some challenges that I encountered. One challenge is that I haven't done any development in HTML before so I was confused about the code <div specifically because it kept getting me red errors on the glitch. I realized that the reason why was because I was not putting spaces between certain codes because I was too used to java that I forgot that spaces matter in HTML. I remind myself to put spaces whenever I had to put code between the button ids to make sure they would click with different colors and with a different tone. Another challenged that I encountered was that the turns were not working at all for some reason. I had to figure out why it was not working whenever I pressed just one button. I then realized that I put the code in another asset so it was not registered or working at all. It is fixed now though.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  I was actually curious how three-dimensional games work on websites. For example, Runescape used to be a three-dimensional browser game that you could play, but now it is strictly a java desktop game. I know that game development on websites must be extremely difficult to make, but I was actually curious they implement the three dimensions into websites. Like how do they make three-dimensional objects show up on the browsers. The next thing I wanted to learn is how to use Mysql with website development. I remember using it when I was creating a Minecraft server, whenever a player would buy something on my old website it would gift them a plot in the game as well. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  Some things I would have added if I had more time, I would have figured out how to add shapes that way the user can pick a certain shape that matches that pattern. Another thing I could have added if I spend more time was researching a way to add a leaderboard of who could have finished the pattern the fastest and leave that at the end of the game. I also wanted to add a share link that the user could have clicked on and shared their results on social media that could have brought more players to the game.
